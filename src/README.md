# Intro

This is my personal journal on different topics I find interesting
as I travel through life at approximately one second per second.
My goal is to collect notes and thoughts and place them here for
safe keeping.  If you press the `s` key a live search will appear
and may help you find what you're looking for more quickly.

## Top Projects

- [`req_md`] : **Requests via Markdown**

  > This is a CLI tool that understands how form http requests from an
  > easy to read and understand markdown format.  Currently it is just
  > a Rust binary; however, I have hopes of also fashioning a Neovim
  > plugin around it.

- [`elastic_lens`] : **Ergonomic Elasticsearch Client in Rust**

  > Does what it says on the tin.  I work with Elasticsearch a lot for
  > my day job and when I wanted to get my hands wet with a bigger Rust
  > project this was the outcome.  It currently powers a real world use
  > case for us.

- [`mdbook-journal`] : **Journal Plugin for [`mdbook`]**

  > Plugin that powers the bulk of this journal that you are reading.
  > This tool allows you to quickly add and organize journal content
  > within a markdown book.  As I get time I plan to add a lot more
  > interesting features to it that has better "blog-like" functionality.
